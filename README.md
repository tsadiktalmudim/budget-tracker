## Description
### The Budget Tracker App is a PWA-like enhanced website that utilizes indexedDB in order to able to cache offline requests and upload them when your browser comes back online. It is a budget tracking app, as the name suggests, however.

## Usage
### If you wish to start a server from your local computer then you will have to clone this repo to your machine, use your command prompt of choice and navigate to it, then type ``npm install`` which will download the necessary files to be able to start the server from your machine. Once downloaded, type ``npm start`` and the server will be started. You can then navigate to http://localhost:3001 on your browser of choice and begin to use this application. However, if you do not wish to do this, then you can visit the linked heroku deployment below and utilize the app. Simply enter in the name of your debit/credit, the amount and click the corresponding button to either credit or debit the account.
